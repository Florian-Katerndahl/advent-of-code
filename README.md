# Advent of Code

This repo contains my attempts at solving the puzzles presented in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

The solutions were written and run on a Linux machine, it's likely they are not portable! To compile the solutions, you need a C compiler, e.g. `gcc`; I tried to remember to compile all programs with the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -fsanitize=address`.
