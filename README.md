# Advent of Code

This repo contains my attempts at solving the puzzles presented in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
There is not really an more to say than that, apart from: The chance of this getting completet ever is fairly slim
and I'll see how long I'm actually motivated on working on this project.

## Setup

If, for whatever reason, you want to clone and set up this repository for yourself, you need:

1. You need a C compiler (e.g. `gcc`)
2. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Florian-Katerndhal/advent-of-code.git
cd advent-of-code
```
